# YACHACK_OPENCV

## Getting started

Code in Python, for the operation of a 4WD or 2WD robot, using OPENCV, in [Control P(kp)](https://github.com/BrianBot24/YACHACK_OPENCV/blob/main/Kp_line.py) and [Control PID.](https://github.com/BrianBot24/YACHACK_OPENCV/blob/main/Line_Follower.py)

### INSTALL WEBCAM
Visit Link: [Using a standard USB webcam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/webcams/)

### INSTALL WEBCAM UVC
Execute in Terminal:

_sudo rmmod uvcvideo_

_sudo modprobe uvcvideo quirks=2_

## _(add imagen terminal RPi)_

### HOW THE CONTROL PID WORKS

The algorithm was conducted similar to that of a follower line with sensors IR.
